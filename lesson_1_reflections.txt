By just showing me the areas that were different, I was able to quickly scan through the code and identify the issue. This is a very usefull tool for keeping track of changes to the code and being able to reference older versions. 

Seeing a file's history allows me to quickly troubleshoot different version of the file to see when certain errors showed up and then identify the changes that lead to those errors. 

The pros of manual commits are you deside when a suffienct amount of changes were made in order to justify a commit. The downside is if you forget to make commits or have a computer crash, changes can get lost. 

Google docs isn't made for files that are interconnected unlike Git. 

Git log allows you to pull up all the commits and scroll thorugh them. git diff allows you to compare 2 commits to see what the changes were and scroll through them. 

Version control will allow me to easily compare code to see why the new version is acting incorrectly. I can always go back if a feature doesn't work. 

I intend to use Git to improve my website more effectivly.
